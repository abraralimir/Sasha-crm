/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SashaLeads AI application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by enforcing strict access control based on authentication and explicit authorization checks.
 * It assumes a public group chat where all authenticated users can read messages, and users can only manage their profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles. Access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - /messages/{messageId}: Stores chat messages. All authenticated users can read messages, and all authenticated users can create messages.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly denied for privacy.
 * - Public read access is granted to the /messages collection, assuming it contains general chat data.
 * - Users are only able to create messages, but no edit or delete them.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  -The current data structure doesn't require denormalization.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - No structural segregation is needed as the application has basic data.
