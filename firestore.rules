/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SashaLeads AI application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles, allowing each
 * user to read and write their own data. It also allows authenticated users
 * to freely read and create chat messages, and manage leads and tasks.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles.
 * - /messages/{messageId}: Stores chat messages accessible to all authenticated users.
 * - /leads/{leadId}: Stores lead data accessible to all authenticated users.
 * - /tasks/{taskId}: Stores task data accessible to all authenticated users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only list other users, but not get their data (corrected from the error).
 * - Chat messages are publicly readable by authenticated users.
 * - Lead and task data are manageable by all authenticated users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The current data structure does not require denormalization, as authorization
 *    is primarily based on user authentication and ownership of user profiles, or
 *    open access for messages, leads and tasks.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  - No structural segregation is currently implemented. All messages are stored
 *    in a single collection. If private user-specific messages were added, they
 *    would be stored in a subcollection under the user's document.
