/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SashaLeads AI video/audio calling.
 *
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-centric security model.
 *   - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 *   - Users can only access files they have uploaded.
 *   - Call session data is accessible only to the participants (caller and callee).
 *   - All write operations require a valid, authenticated user.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 *   - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.
 *   - /users/{userId}/files/{fileId}: Stores files uploaded by the user.
 *   - /call_sessions/{callSessionId}: Stores call session details.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *   - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 *   - The rules explicitly deny any ambiguous access to enforce a default-deny posture.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *   - CallSession documents denormalize `callerId` and `calleeId` to enable simple, direct authorization checks.
